Today we're announcing version **2.1.0** of Rematch. More or less 4 months passed since we opened the [Roadmap for version 2.1.0](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/issues/896). Here we are writing this post telling you guys all the incredible improvements and features we introduced to this new version of Rematch.

### Bug fixes

- Typescript 4.3.X typings was causing some issues with `connect()` method and Rematch. [#893](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/issues/893)
- When the `payload` of an effect or reducer was explicitly adding a default value in case of null, wasn't getting inferred. [#894](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/issues/894)
- When using `this` object accessor inside `effects` property, wasn't autocompleted. Since getting autocomplete was like a super-man task we ended up at least not throwing an error of any. Now returns an `Action<any, any>` [#870](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/issues/870)
- `init()` function now accepts Rematch models like `Partial<RootModel>`, this can be used in conjuntion with store function `store.addModel()` for dynamically adding models. [#892](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/pull/892)
- Loading plugin returns the chain of promises, that means if an effect crashes you can catch that error. [#907](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/pull/907)
- Upgrading TypeScript from `4.1.2` version to `4.3.X` caused some unexpected `never` types. [#912](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/issues/912)
- [`Immer`](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) peer dependency of `@rematch/immer` plugin updated to > 9, we keep our official plugins updated.

### New features

- We officially released `@rematch/typed-state` plugin, was an official plugin for Rematch v1, but we didn't back ported it to v2 since now. It's just `258 bytes`, and recommended to anyone who wants to encourage a good shape of state on any JavaScript codebase. [You can read more about this plugin in the official documentation.](https://rematchjs.org/docs/plugins/typed-state/)
- `@rematch/loading` now has been refactored to accept more options than `boolean` or `number`, now you can pass `

**Store as full object**

Passing `full` to config will create a shape where if any effect promise crashes, will save the error object inside `error`, if the promise resolves correctly will set `success` to true, and if it keeps loading, will keep the `loading` property to true.
It's quite similar to React-Query library, and really powerful for building interactive libraries without writing tons of reducers for our effects.

```ts
type FullModel = ExtraModelsFromLoading<RootModel, { type: 'full' }>

export const store = init<RootModel, FullModel>({
	models,
	plugins: [loadingPlugin({ type: 'full' })],
})
```

**Store as numbers**

Will work as usual, when a effect is loading will increment the number of the state.

```ts
type FullModel = ExtraModelsFromLoading<RootModel, { type: 'number' }>

export const store = init<RootModel, FullModel>({
	models,
	plugins: [loadingPlugin({ type: 'number' })],
})
```

**Store as booleans**

`true` or `false` given the effect promise if it's resolved or not.

```ts
type FullModel = ExtraModelsFromLoading<RootModel>

export const store = init<RootModel, FullModel>({
	models,
	plugins: [loadingPlugin()],
})
```

You can see the pull request implementation [here](https://github.com/rematch/rematch/pull/922) and read more about this on the official documentation [here](https://rematchjs.org/docs/plugins/loading/).

### Chore

- Now we test every night our entire CI setup with `latest` and `next` TypeScript versions, which means a bunch of tests integration, unit and even end-to-end in a real world React application written with TypeScript with all our plugins is tested before TypeScript releases a new version.
  :::info
  This will avoid issues with future versions of Rematch + TypeScript since we're testing before TypeScript officially releases the version is causing issues, giving us time to fix the issue on Rematch side.
  :::
- Now we added [`shiki-twoslash`](https://github.com/shikijs/twoslash) to Rematch documentation, now you can see the powerful of Rematch with TypeScript directly in the browser, not needed to download any project, just check the typings as you would do on your favorite code editor.

```twoslash include countModel
// @filename: count.ts
import { createModel } from '@rematch/core'
import { RootModel } from "./models"

export const count = createModel<RootModel>()({
	state: 0,
	reducers: {
		increment(state, payload: number) {
			return state + payload
		},
	},
	effects: (dispatch) => ({
		incrementAsync(payload: number, state) {
			dispatch.count.increment(payload)
		},
	}),
})
```

```twoslash include rootModel
// @filename: models.ts
import { Models } from "@rematch/core"
import { count } from "./count"

export interface RootModel extends Models<RootModel> {
  count: typeof count
}

export const models: RootModel = { count }
```

```twoslash include store
// @filename: store.ts
import { init, RematchDispatch, RematchRootState } from '@rematch/core'
import { models, RootModel } from './models'

/** Plugins **/
import updatedPlugin, { ExtraModelsFromUpdated } from '@rematch/updated'
import loadingPlugin, { ExtraModelsFromLoading } from '@rematch/loading'

type FullModel =  ExtraModelsFromLoading<RootModel> & ExtraModelsFromUpdated<RootModel>

export const store = init<RootModel, FullModel>({
	models,
	plugins: [
		loadingPlugin(),
		updatedPlugin(),
	]
})

export type Store = typeof store
export type Dispatch = RematchDispatch<RootModel>
export type RootState = RematchRootState<RootModel>
```

For instance, check this `count` model:

```ts twoslash
// @include: rootModel
// @filename: count.ts
// ---cut---
import { createModel } from '@rematch/core'
import type { RootModel } from './models'

export const count = createModel<RootModel>()({
	state: 0,
	reducers: {
		increment(state, payload: number) {
			return state + payload
		},
	},
	effects: (dispatch) => ({
		incrementAsync(payload: number, state) {
			dispatch.count.increment(payload)
		},
	}),
})
```

Hope you enjoy this new release, feel free install it as usual with your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install @rematch/core --save
```
