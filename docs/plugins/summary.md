# Plugins Summary {docsify-ignore}

Plugins extend Rematch functionality. They are optional but very helpful. Below you can find a summary of plugins created by the Rematch team. You can also try searching in npm/github for plugins created by the community or create plugins yourself.

?> If you can't find a plugin you need - you can always create one yourself. Head over to the [Plugins API](api/plugins.md#plugins-api) for more details.

Plugins:

- [Immer Plugin](plugins/immer.md) - Wraps your reducers with immer, providing ability to safely do mutable changes resulting in immutable state.

- [Persist Plugin](plugins/persist.md) - Redux persist wrapper.

- [Select Plugin](plugins/select.md) - Reselect selectors for Rematch models.
