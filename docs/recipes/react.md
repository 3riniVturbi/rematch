# React

Moving from plain old Redux with React to Rematch is easy. It really involves no necessary changes with your components.

However, you may choose to simplify your `connect` statements. See an example below:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'

const Counter = props => (
	<div>
		<h2>Count: {props.count}</h2>
		<button onClick={props.increment} />
	</div>
)

const mapState = (state, ownProps) => ({
	count: state.count,
})

const mapDispatch = dispatch => ({
	increment: () => dispatch.count.increment(),
})
// You can also use destructuring
const mapDispatchWithDestructure = ({ count: { increment } }) => ({ increment })

export default connect(
	mapState,
	mapDispatch
)(Counter)
```

Note that it's recommended you keep your `dispatch` statements within mapDispatch. This keeps your components pure for testing.

Use `store` to setup your React-Redux Provider.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { init } from '@rematch/core'
import App from './App'

const store = init()

export default () => (
	<Provider store={store}>
		<App />
	</Provider>
)
```
